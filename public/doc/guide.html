<b>Messages</b>
<p>
ScriptRemote provides some basic organizational structure for messages
in order to help support sharing and navigation. The levels of the
this organizational hierarchy are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>project</li>
<li>job</li>
<li>location</li>
<li>message</li>
</ul>
<p>
A project might correspond to a simple script of your own or to a
more complex, shared workspace. A project contains jobs, has a unique
name and owner, and is the unit of sharing between users.
<p>
A job represents a single execution of a script. The script will declare
the project it belongs to in its first request to the server and the project
will be created if it does not already exist. The job 
naming scheme allows the script to declare a meaningful, but not necessarily 
unique, name and leaves it to the server to assign a job identfier that 
is unique within the project.  This means that repeated runs of the same script 
will not cause a problem.
<p>
A location is just a tag that can be used to group messages within
a job. A common use would be identify where in a script the message
originated. Every job has a least one user-defined location
and an 'end' location.
<p>
A message contains data in the form of a sequence of name-value pairs,
where the names and values are strings, plus optional attached files.
The supported file types are text, svg image, and png image.
The server assigns message identifiers that are unique within a
location.
<p>
Messaging is incorporated into script control flow as follows.
A script can send messages to the server at any time. It can only
receive a message as a reply to a previously sent message and it
must wait for the reply after sending the message. A maximum
wait time can be specified. Script execution continues when the
reply is received or the maximum wait is exceeded. The received
message has the same name-value pairs except that the values
may have been changed by the sender.
<p>
Messages remain on the server until deleted, which is normally done
by deleting the parent job or project in the browser.
Messages will also be deleted by the server automatically if
the maximum message count for a location is reached. The
maximum is set by the script when starting a job.
<p>
In the browser the message hierarchy is under the 'Projects' 
main menu section. You navigate down the hierarchy by clicking
on links in the lists, and navigate up by clicking on links
in the 'breadcrumbs' menu bar which shows the current
position in the hierarchy. You can also use the browser's back arrow.

<div id="scriptutilities">
<b>Script Utilities</b>
<p>
The script utilities are the interface to the server's API
endpoints. They provide high-level calls to start a job, send
and receive messages, and end the job.
Currently there are versions for bash and python2.7.
They require some standard packages like opennssl and pycrypto
that are normally available on linux systems, or can readily be 
installed.
<p>
The detailed documentation for the utilities is contained in
the corresponding file, which can be downloaded via:
<pre>
    wget https://scriptremote.com/dist/srjob.sh 
    wget https://scriptremote.com/dist/srjob.py 
</pre>
The utilities need to know the server's domain and the protocol,
https or http depending on whether the server is public or private.
These can be configured by setting an environment variable.

<div id="usersandauth">
<b>Users and Authentication</b>
<p>
Using ScriptRemote requires registration and authentication with
the server.  Registration is done via the browser interface
by providing a valid email and a password, at a minimum.  The first user 
to register after installation is automatically the server admin. The 
admin controls the registration method for other users, if any. The
possible methods are: for other users to register themselves, for them
to register with admin approval, or to be registered manually by
the admin. The admin user can also disable or delete users and
send admin emails.
<p>
After registration, the two types of clients that can connect to the 
server use different authentication methods.  Browser clients use 
login/session-cookie authentication. Script clients use the HTTP 
Basic Auth header to send a user id and a token with every request. 
The user id and token values are obtained from the server via the 
browser, and must be provided to the script when it starts, for 
example through setting environment variables. 
<p>
While the user id is fixed, a new token can be generated anytime
and becomes the 'current' token.  When a job starts its token must
match the current value. However the server stores the token with 
a job and thereafter all requests from the script related to 
the job can continue to use the same value, even if new tokens 
are generated in the meantime.
<p>
In the browser token generation is located in the 'Settings' main
menu section.  Email and password login credentials can also be updated
there.

<div id="projectsharing">
<b>Project Sharing</b>
<p>
If there are multiple users of a server then their messages
are kept separate in the database and by default no sharing
is allowed.
<p>
If desired, messages can be shared on a per-project basis. 
Sharing is controlled by the project's owner, the user
who created it. To share with another user, the owner
edits the project's Authorized Users settings in the browser and
specifies the email of the user together with a permission level.
The permission levels are 'read', 'reply', and 'write'.
Project settings are accessed through the 'cog' icon when
the project is viewed in the browser.
<p>
To access the shared data the other user edits her sharing
settings under the 'Settings' main menu section and specifies 
the owner's email and project name. This adds the shared 
project to the list of
known projects for the user. The shared project is identified
by the combination of name and owner email, so there is no 
conflict if the same project name is already present in
the list.
<p>
For read permission the sharing user will just be able to
view the project messages in the browser. With reply permission
the user can also send replies to any messages that are
waiting for a response. With write permission the user can do anything
with the project except delete it, including adding and 
deleting jobs.

<div id="templates">
<b>Templates</b>
<p>
Templates provide a way to dynamically modify the browser UI for 
messages in order to customize the presentation of specific kinds
of data. 
<p>
There are two types of template, one for the non-reply
part of a message  and one for the reply part, 
if any. All the messages in a job with a given location 
will use the same pair of templates.
<p>
ScriptRemote installs with default templates that will be used
for all locations. The default templates simply display the name-value
pairs of the message and the attachments in sequence with minimal
styling. 
<p>
Users can create new templates and upload them to the server.
The 'Templates' menu section in the browser is for managing templates,
including uploading, viewing, and deleting templates and changing
the global defaults. The templates for a location are controlled
by the location's settings, which are accessed through the 'cog'
icon when the location is viewed in the browser.
<p>
Templates are coded in HTML plus <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS 1</a> 
extensions. CSS and bootstrap can be used for custom styling.

<div id="encryption">
<b>Encryption</b>
<p>
End-to-end encryption between script and browser is an option
that can be used on a per-project basis. A project will be encrypted
if an encryption passphrase is specified by the script when the
project is created. The passphrase is used to generate the symetric 
encryption key. 
It is never sent over the wire, either by the the script 
utilities or the browser.
<p>
The passphrase of a project is fixed at the time it is created.
If a later job attempts to use a different passphrase with the same 
project name it will actually create a new project in the server 
with the same plaintext name but a different encrypted name.
<p>
All user-defined
data is encrypted before transmission to the server, including 
project name, job and location names, and message content.
The reply part of a message, if any, is also cryptographically
signed.
Likewise any reply message received from the server must have been encrypted
and signed using the same passphrase or the script utility will
flag an error.
<p>
To decrypt a project in the browser the user needs to
supply the correct passphrase, under the 'Settings' menu section.
If the passphrase is not set in the browser, or has the wrong value, the user
will just see encrypted, random-looking values when
viewing the project.
<p>
It is also possible to encrypt templates when uploading them to
the server, by setting a passphrase before starting the upload.
The same passphrase then has to be in effect when viewing the
template code or using it with a project. Consequently if both
project and templates are encrypted their passphrases must be
the same.
<p>
Encryption protects templates that contain sensitive data, and
can also help to prevent script injection attacks.
<p>
If templates are encrypted and no passphrase is set when viewing
a project then the browser will attempt to revert to the 
ScriptRemote global default templates.

<div id="notifications">
<b>Notifications</b>
<p>
Notifications is an option to have the server send SMS texts
when new messages arrive from projects owned by or being shared by the user.
<p>
To use it you need to have set an SMS gateway email address, either during registration
or later in the 'Settings' menu section. The text messages are actually generated by
sending emails to the gateway. Most of the major carriers provide such a gateway.
<p>
Notifications are per-project and are enabled in the project settings. A project nickname
can also be specified there. The nickname will be included in the message header, which is
particularly useful for encrypted projects where the server does not have access to the
plaintext project name. 
<p>
A notification contains a shortened link to the new ScriptRemote message. If the user
is not currently logged in in their browser, the link will redirect to the login page
instead of the message.
